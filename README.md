# Home Loan Default Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of home loan defaults using machine learning techniques.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **Notebook**:
  - `Block_48_Unit_5_CareerSimulation.ipynb`: Contains the data analysis, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation processes.
- **Configuration**:
  - `requirements_cs.txt`: Lists the Python packages required to run the notebook.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tybreen/Home-Loan-Default-Prediction-Project.git
   ```

2. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements_cs.txt
   ```

3. Run the Notebook:

   Open the Jupyter notebook `Block_48_Unit_5_CareerSimulation.ipynb` to explore the analysis and findings.

## üîç Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that assesses the risk of a borrower defaulting on a home loan. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and applying various machine learning algorithms to achieve optimal prediction performance.
